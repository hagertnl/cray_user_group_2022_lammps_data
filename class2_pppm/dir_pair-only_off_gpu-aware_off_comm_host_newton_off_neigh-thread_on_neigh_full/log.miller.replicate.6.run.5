  what():  Kokkos failed to allocate memory for label "neighbors".  Allocation using MemorySpace named "Cuda" failed with the following error:  Allocation of size 25.37 G failed, likely due to insufficient memory.  (The allocation mechanism was cudaMalloc().  The Cuda allocation returned the error code ""cudaErrorMemoryAllocation".)
