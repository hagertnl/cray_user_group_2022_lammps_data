  what():  Kokkos failed to allocate memory for label "neighbors".  Allocation using MemorySpace named "HIP" failed with the following error:  Allocation of size 64.53 G failed, likely due to insufficient memory.  (The allocation mechanism was hipMalloc().  The HIP allocation returned the error code ""hipErrorOutOfMemory".)
